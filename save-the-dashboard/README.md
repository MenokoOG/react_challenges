# React + Vite Project 14

 Challenge

    The save button doesn't actually save the user's widget configuration. Your task is to fix this as follows: 

    	1. When the user clicks the save button and thereby invokes the save function on line 36 
		   below, the widgetConfig state array should be saved to localStorage. 
       
    	2. The widgetConfig state should be initialized as the array saved to localStorage in the 
	  	   previous step, if any array has been saved. Otherwise, it should set be initialized as DEFAULT_CONFIG.  
			 
	Note: The save button has already been set up to invoke the save function. 
              
    Bonus challenge: Complete the second task by using lazy state initialization.
