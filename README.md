- passing and receiving props
- Creating and updating state
- Conditional rendering and styling
- Event handlers
- Controlled form elements
- Working with APIs and local storage
- Timing Events, usEffect, and more hooks.
- Organizing and refactoring code
- keeping it nice and DRY
- Implementing algorithmic logic
- Improving UX
